# PiPlayer

Launch videos on your Raspberry Pi from a web browser


## Setup

Place the contents of 'www' in your web directory

Modify the videoDir and webDir variables in scripts/listVideos.py to reflect your configuration

Make sure the user who executes listVideos.py has the permissions to write in you web directory in order to save the list

Also, the www-data user needs to be part of the group 'video' to be allowed to use omxplayer:
`usermod -aG video www-data`
